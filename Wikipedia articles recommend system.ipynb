       "1     Conditional probability  In probability theory, a conditional probability is the probability that an event will occur, when another event is known to occur or to have occurred. If the events are \"A\" and \"B\" respectively, this is said to be \"the probability of \"A\" given \"B\"\". It is commonly denoted by \"P\"(\"A\"|\"B\"), or sometimes \"P\"(\"A\"). \"P\"(\"A\"|\"B\") may or may not be equal to \"P\"(\"A\"), the probability of \"A\". If they are equal, \"A\" and \"B\" are said to be independent. For example, if a coin is flipped twice, \"the outcome of the second flip\" is independent of \"the outcome of the first flip\". In the Bayesian interpretation of probability, the conditioning event is interpreted as evidence for the conditioned event. That is, \"P\"(\"A\") is the probability of \"A\" before accounting for evidence \"E\", and \"P\"(\"A\"|\"E\") is the probability of \"A\" having accounted for evidence \"E\". Definition. Conditioning on an event. Kolmogorov definition. Given two events \"A\" and \"B\" with \"P\"(\"B\") > 0, the conditional probability of \"A\" given \"B\" is defined as the quotient of the joint probability of \"A\" and \"B\", and the probability of \"B\": This may be visualized as restricting the sample space to \"B\". The logic behind this equation is that if the outcomes are restricted to \"B\", this set serves as the new sample space. As an axiom of probability. Some authors, such as De Finetti, prefer to introduce conditional probability as an axiom of probability: Although mathematically equivalent, this may be preferred philosophically; under major probability interpretations such as the subjective theory, conditional probability is considered a primitive entity. Further, this \"multiplication axiom\" introduces a symmetry with the summation axiom for mutually exclusive events: Definition with σ-algebra. If \"P\"(\"B\") = 0, then the simple definition of \"P\"(\"A\"|\"B\") is undefined. However, it is possible to define a conditional probability with respect to a σ-algebra of such events (such as those arising from a continuous random variable). For example, if \"X\" and \"Y\" are non-degenerate and jointly continuous random variables with density \"ƒ\"(\"x\", \"y\") then, if \"B\" has positive measure, The case where \"B\" has zero measure can only be dealt with directly in the case that \"B\" = {\"y\"}, representing a single point, in which case If \"A\" has measure zero then the conditional probability is zero. An indication of why the more general case of zero measure cannot be dealt with in a similar way can be seen by noting that the limit, as all \"δy\" approach zero, of depends on their relationship as they approach zero. See conditional expectation for more information. Conditioning on a random variable. Conditioning on an event may be generalized to conditioning on a random variable. Let \"X\" be a random variable taking some value from \"x\". Let \"A\" be an event. The conditional probability of \"A\" given \"X\" is defined as the random variable: More formally: The conditional probability \"P\"(\"A\"|\"X\") is a function of \"X\", e.g., if the function \"g\" is defined as then Note that \"P\"(\"A\"|\"X\") and \"X\" are now both random variables. From the law of total probability, the expected value of \"P\"(\"A\"|\"X\") is equal to the unconditional probability of \"A\". Example. Suppose that somebody secretly rolls two fair six-sided dice, and we must predict the outcome. What is the probability that \"A\" = 2? Table 1 shows the sample space. \"A\" = 2 in 6 of the 36 outcomes, thus \"P\"(\"A\"=2) =  = . Suppose it is revealed that \"A\"+\"B\" ≤ 5. Table 2 shows that \"A\"+\"B\" ≤ 5 for 10 outcomes. For 3 of these, \"A\" = 2. So the probability that \"A\" = 2 \"given that\" \"A\"+\"B\" ≤ 5 is \"P\"(\"A\"=2 | \"A\"+\"B\" ≤ 5) =  = 0.3. Statistical independence. Events \"A\" and \"B\" are defined to be statistically independent if: That is, the occurrence of \"A\" does not affect the probability of \"B\", and vice versa. Although the derived forms may seem more intuitive, they are not the preferred definition as the conditional probabilities may be undefined if \"P\"(\"A\") or \"P\"(\"B\") are 0, and the preferred definition is symmetrical in \"A\" and \"B\". Common fallacies. Assuming conditional probability is of similar size to its inverse. In general, it cannot be assumed that \"P\"(\"A\"|\"B\") ≈ \"P\"(\"B\"|\"A\"). This can be an insidious error, even for those who are highly conversant with statistics. The relationship between \"P\"(\"A\"|\"B\") and \"P\"(\"B\"|\"A\") is given by Bayes' theorem: That is, \"P\"(\"A\"|\"B\") ≈ \"P\"(\"B\"|\"A\") only if \"P\"(\"B\")/\"P\"(\"A\") ≈ 1, or equivalently, \"P\"(\"A\") ≈ \"P\"(\"B\"). Alternatively, noting that \"A\" ∩ \"B\" = \"B\" ∩ \"A\", and applying conditional probability: Rearranging gives the result. Assuming marginal and conditional probabilities are of similar size. In general, it cannot be assumed that \"P\"(\"A\") ≈ \"P\"(\"A\"|\"B\"). These probabilities are linked through the formula for total probability: This fallacy may arise through selection bias. For example, in the context of a medical claim, let \"S\" be the event that a sequela (chronic disease) \"S\" occurs as a consequence of circumstance (acute condition) \"C\". Let \"H\" be the event that an individual seeks medical help. Suppose that in most cases, \"C\" does not cause \"S\" so \"P\"(\"S\") is low. Suppose also that medical attention is only sought if \"S\" has occurred due to \"C\". From experience of patients, a doctor may therefore erroneously conclude that \"P\"(\"S\") is high. The actual probability observed by the doctor is \"P\"(\"S\"|\"H\"). Over- or under-weighting priors. Not taking prior probability into account partially or completely is called \"base rate neglect\". The reverse, insufficient adjustment from the prior probability is \"conservatism. Formal derivation. Formally, \"P\"(\"A\"|\"B\") is defined as the probability of \"A\" according to a new probability function on the sample space, such that outcomes not in \"B\" have probability 0 and that it is consistent with all original probability measures. Let Ω be a sample space with elementary events {ω}. Suppose we are told the event \"B\" ⊆ Ω has occurred. A new probability distribution (denoted by the conditional notation) is to be assigned on {ω} to reflect this. For events in \"B\", it is reasonable to assume that the relative magnitudes of the probabilities will be preserved. For some constant scale factor α, the new distribution will therefore satisfy: Substituting 1 and 2 into 3 to select α: So the new probability distribution is Now for a general event \"A\", \n",

       "1     Cartesian product  In mathematics, a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation which returns a set (or product set) from multiple sets. That is, for sets \"A\" and \"B\", the Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs where and . The simplest case of a Cartesian product is the Cartesian square, which returns a set from two sets. A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form . A Cartesian product of \"n\" sets can be represented by an array of \"n\" dimensions, where each element is an \"n\"-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple. The Cartesian product is named after René Descartes, whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept. Examples. A deck of cards. An illustrative example is the Standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13 element-set. The card suits form a 4-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards. returns a set of the form {(Ace, ♠), (King, ♠), ..., (2, ♠), (Ace, ♥), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♣)}. returns a set of the form {(♠, Ace), (♠, King), ..., (♠, 2 ), (♥, Ace), ..., (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}. A two-dimensional coordinate system. An example in analytic geometry is the Cartesian plane. The Cartesian plane is the result of the Cartesian product of two sets \"X\" and \"Y\", which refer to points on the x-axis and points on the y-axis, respectively. This Cartesian product can be denoted as . This produces the set of all possible ordered pairs whose first component is a member of \"X\" and whose second component is a member of \"Y\" (e.g., the whole of the x–y plane). Alternatively, the Cartesian product can be denoted as , in which case the first component of the order pair is a member of \"Y\" and the second component of the ordered pair is a member of \"X\". The Cartesian product is consequently not commutative. Most common implementation (set theory). A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is formula_4. Note that, under this definition, formula_5, where formula_6 represents the power set. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions. Non-commutativity and non-associativity. Let \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\" be sets. The Cartesian product is not commutative, because the ordered pairs are reversed except if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied: For example: Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless the above condition occurs). Intersections, unions, and subsets. The Cartesian product acts nicely with respect to intersections. Notice that in most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union. Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators: Other properties related with subsets are: Cardinality. The cardinality of a set is similar to the number of elements of the set. For a simpler example, defining two sets: } and Both set \"A\" and set \"B\" consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as , results in a new set which has the following elements: Each element of \"A\" is combined with each element of \"B\". Each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each pair is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; hence 2 in this case. The cardinality of the result set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is, and similarly and so on. The cardinality of is also infinity if \"A\" or \"B\" is an infinite set and the other is not the empty set. Cartesian square and Cartesian power. The Cartesian square (or binary Cartesian product) of a set \"X\" is the Cartesian product . An example is the 2-dimensional plane where R is the set of real numbers – all points where \"x\" and \"y\" are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system). Higher powers of a set. The cartesian power of a set \"X\" can be defined as: An example of this is , with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally R\"n\". Generalized powers from different sets. n-ary product. The Cartesian product can be generalized to the \"n\"-ary Cartesian product over \"n\" sets \"X\"1, ..., \"Xn\": It is a set of \"n\"-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified to . The \"n\"-ary cartesian power of a set \"X\" is isomorphic to the space of functions from an \"n\"-element set to \"X\". As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of \"X\" may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain \"X\". Infinite products. It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If \"I\" is any index set, and formula_19 is a collection of sets indexed by \"I\", then the Cartesian product of the sets in \"X\" is defined to be  that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index \"i\" is an element of \"Xi\". Even if each of the \"Xi\" is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed. For each \"j\" in \"I\", the function  defined by formula_22 is called the \"j\"th projection map. An important case is when the index set is formula_23, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the \"i\"th term in its corresponding set \"Xi\". For example, each element of  can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted formula_25, or formula_26. The special case Cartesian exponentiation occurs when all the factors \"Xi\" involved in the product are the same set \"X\". In this case,  is the set of all functions from \"I\" to \"X\", and is frequently denoted \"XI\". This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation.  The definition of finite Cartesian products can be seen as a special case of the definition for infinite products. In this interpretation, an \"n\"-tuple can be viewed as a function on that takes its value at \"i\" to be the \"i\"th element of the tuple (in some settings, this is taken as the very definition of an \"n\"-tuple). Nothing in the definition of an infinite Cartesian product implies that the Cartesian product of nonempty sets must itself be nonempty. This assertion is equivalent to the axiom of choice. Other forms. Abbreviated form. If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. \"X\"1, \"X\"2, \"X\"3, …, then some authors choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×\"X\"\"i\". Cartesian product of functions. If \"f\" is a function from \"A\" to \"B\" and \"g\" is a function from \"X\" to \"Y\", their Cartesian product is a function from to with This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. Note that this is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets. Definitions outside of Set theory. Category theory. Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product. Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category. Graph theory. In graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs \"G\" and \"H\" is the graph denoted by whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product and such that two vertices (\"u\",\"v\") and (\"u\"′,\"v\"′) are adjacent in if and only if and \"u\"′ is adjacent with \"v\"′ in \"H\", \"or\" and \"u\" is adjacent with \"v\" in \"G\". The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs. \n",

       "1     1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers  In 1964 three teams proposed related but different approaches to explain how mass could arise in local gauge theories. These three, now famous, papers were written by Robert Brout and François Englert, Peter Higgs, and Gerald Guralnik, C. Richard Hagen, and Tom Kibble, and are credited with the theory of the Higgs mechanism and the prediction of the Higgs field and Higgs boson. Together, these provide a theoretical means by which Goldstone's theorem (a problematic limitation affecting early modern particle physics theories) can be avoided. They show how gauge bosons can acquire non-zero masses as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking within gauge invariant models of the universe. As such, these form the key element of the electroweak theory that forms part of the Standard Model of particle physics, and of many models, such as the Grand Unified Theory, that go beyond it. The papers that introduce this mechanism were published in \"Physical Review Letters\" (PRL) and were each recognized as milestone papers by PRL's 50th anniversary celebration. Additionally, all of the six physicists were awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics for this work. On 4 July 2012, the two main experiments at the LHC (ATLAS and CMS) both reported independently the confirmed existence of a previously unknown particle with a mass of about (about 133 proton masses, on the order of 10−25 kg), which is \"consistent with the Higgs boson\" and widely believed to be the Higgs boson. Introduction. A gauge theory of elementary particles is a very attractive potential framework for constructing the ultimate theory. Such a theory has the very desirable property of being potentially renormalizable—shorthand for saying that all calculational infinities encountered can be consistently absorbed into a few parameters of the theory. However, as soon as one gives mass to the gauge fields, renormalizability is lost, and the theory rendered useless. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a promising mechanism, which could be used to give mass to the vector gauge particles. A significant difficulty which one encounters, however, is Goldstone's theorem, which states that in any quantum field theory which has a spontaneously broken symmetry there must occur a zero-mass particle. So the problem arises—how can one break a symmetry and at the same time not introduce unwanted zero-mass particles. The resolution of this dilemma lies in the observation that in the case of gauge theories, the Goldstone theorem can be avoided by working in the so-called radiation gauge. This is because the proof of Goldstone's theorem requires manifest Lorentz covariance, a property not possessed by the radiation gauge. History. Particle physicists study matter made from fundamental particles whose interactions are mediated by exchange particles known as force carriers. At the beginning of the 1960s a number of these particles had been discovered or proposed, along with theories suggesting how they relate to each other, some of which had already been reformulated as field theories in which the objects of study are not particles and forces, but quantum fields and their symmetries. However, attempts to unify known fundamental forces such as the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force were known to be incomplete. One known omission was that gauge invariant approaches, including non-abelian models such as Yang–Mills theory (1954), which held great promise for unified theories, also seemed to predict known massive particles as massless. Goldstone's theorem, relating to continuous symmetries within some theories, also appeared to rule out many obvious solutions, since it appeared to show that zero-mass particles would have to also exist that were \"simply not seen\". According to Guralnik, physicists had \"no understanding\" how these problems could be overcome. Particle physicist and mathematician Peter Woit summarised the state of research at the time: The Higgs mechanism is a process by which vector bosons can get rest mass \"without\" explicitly breaking gauge invariance, as a byproduct of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The mathematical theory behind spontaneous symmetry breaking was initially conceived and published within particle physics by Yoichiro Nambu in 1960, the concept that such a mechanism could offer a possible solution for the \"mass problem\" was originally suggested in 1962 by Philip Anderson, and Abraham Klein and Benjamin Lee showed in March 1964 that Goldstone's theorem could be avoided this way in at least some non-relativistic cases and speculated it might be possible in truly relativistic cases. These approaches were quickly developed into a full relativistic model, independently and almost simultaneously, by three groups of physicists: by François Englert and Robert Brout in August 1964; by Peter Higgs in October 1964; and by Gerald Guralnik, Carl Hagen, and Tom Kibble (GHK) in November 1964. Higgs also wrote a short but important response published in September 1964 to an objection by Gilbert, which showed that if calculating within the radiation gauge, Goldstone's theorem and Gilbert's objection would become inapplicable. (Higgs later described Gilbert's objection as prompting his own paper.) Properties of the model were further considered by Guralnik in 1965, by Higgs in 1966, by Kibble in 1967, and further by GHK in 1967. The original three 1964 papers showed that when a gauge theory is combined with an additional field that spontaneously breaks the symmetry, the gauge bosons can consistently acquire a finite mass. In 1967, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how a Higgs mechanism could be used to break the electroweak symmetry of Sheldon Glashow's unified model for the weak and electromagnetic interactions (itself an extension of work by Schwinger), forming what became the Standard Model of particle physics. Weinberg was the first to observe that this would also provide mass terms for the fermions.  However, the seminal papers on spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetries were at first largely ignored, because it was widely believed that the (non-Abelian gauge) theories in question were a dead-end, and in particular that they could not be renormalised. In 1971–72, Martinus Veltman and Gerard 't Hooft proved renormalisation of Yang–Mills was possible in two papers covering massless, and then massive, fields. Their contribution, and others' work on the renormalization group, was eventually \"enormously profound and influential\", but even with all key elements of the eventual theory published there was still almost no wider interest. For example, Coleman found in a study that \"essentially no-one paid any attention\" to Weinberg's paper prior to 1971 – now the most cited in particle physics – and even in 1970 according to Politzer, Glashow's teaching of the weak interaction contained no mention of Weinberg's, Salem's, or Glashow's own work. In practice, Politzer states, almost everyone learned of the theory due to physicist Benjamin Lee, who combined the work of Veltman and 't Hooft with insights by others, and popularised the completed theory. In this way, from 1971, interest and acceptance \"exploded\"  and the ideas were quickly absorbed in the mainstream. The significance of requiring manifest covariance. Most students who have taken a course in electromagnetism have encountered the Coulomb potential. It basically states that two charged particles attract or repel each other by a force which varies according to the inverse square of their separation. This is fairly unambiguous for particles at rest, but if one or the other is following an arbitrary trajectory the question arises whether one should compute the force using the instantaneous positions of the particles or the so-called retarded positions. The latter recognizes that information cannot propagate instantaneously, rather it propagates at the speed of light. However, the radiation gauge says that one uses the instantaneous positions of the particles, but doesn't violate causality because there are compensating terms in the force equation. In contrast, the Lorenz gauge imposes manifest covariance (and thus causality) at all stages of a calculation. Predictions of observable quantities are identical in the two gauges, but the radiation gauge formulation of quantum field theory avoids Goldstone's theorem. Summary and impact of the PRL papers. The three papers written in 1964 were each recognised as milestone papers during \"Physical Review Letters\" 50th anniversary celebration. Their six authors were also awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics for this work. (A controversy also arose the same year, because in the event of a Nobel Prize only up to three scientists could be recognised, with six being credited for the papers. ) Two of the three PRL papers (by Higgs and by GHK) contained equations for the hypothetical field that eventually would become known as the Higgs field and its hypothetical quantum, the Higgs boson. Higgs's subsequent 1966 paper showed the decay mechanism of the boson; only a massive boson can decay and the decays can prove the mechanism. Each of these papers is unique and demonstrates different approaches to showing how mass arise in gauge particles. Over the years, the differences between these papers are no longer widely understood, due to the passage of time and acceptance of end-results by the particle physics community. A study of citation indices is interesting—more than 40 years after the 1964 publication in \"Physical Review Letters\" there is little noticeable pattern of preference among them, with the vast majority of researchers in the field mentioning all three milestone papers. In the paper by Higgs the boson is massive, and in a closing sentence Higgs writes that \"an essential feature\" of the theory \"is the prediction of incomplete multiplets of scalar and vector bosons\". (Frank Close comments that 1960s gauge theorists were focused on the problem of massless \"vector\" bosons, and the implied existence of a massive \"scalar\" boson was not seen as important; only Higgs directly addressed it.) In the paper by GHK the boson is massless and decoupled from the massive states. In reviews dated 2009 and 2011, Guralnik states that in the GHK model the boson is massless only in a lowest-order approximation, but it is not subject to any constraint and acquires mass at higher orders, and adds that the GHK paper was the only one to show that there are no massless Goldstone bosons in the model and to give a complete analysis of the general Higgs mechanism. All three reached similar conclusions, despite their very different approaches: Higgs' paper essentially used classical techniques, Englert and Brout's involved calculating vacuum polarization in perturbation theory around an assumed symmetry-breaking vacuum state, and GHK used operator formalism and conservation laws to explore in depth the ways in which Goldstone's theorem may be worked around. In addition to explaining how mass is acquired by vector bosons, the Higgs mechanism also predicts the ratio between the W boson and Z boson masses as well as their couplings with each other and with the Standard Model quarks and leptons. Subsequently, many of these predictions have been verified by precise measurements performed at the LEP and the SLC colliders, thus overwhelmingly confirming that some kind of Higgs mechanism does take place in nature, but the exact manner by which it happens has not yet been discovered. The results of searching for the Higgs boson are expected to provide evidence about how this is realized in nature. Consequences of the papers. The resulting electroweak theory and Standard Model have correctly predicted (among other discoveries) weak neutral currents, three bosons, the top and charm quarks, and with great precision, the mass and other properties of some of these. Many of those involved eventually won Nobel Prizes or other renowned awards. A 1974 paper in \"Reviews of Modern Physics\" commented that \"while no one doubted the correctness of these arguments, no one quite believed that nature was diabolically clever enough to take advantage of them\". By 1986 and again in the 1990s it became possible to write that understanding and proving the Higgs sector of the Standard Model was \"the central problem today in particle physics.\"  \n",

He is best known for being the lead singer and songwriter for the American bands Ima Robot and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. Early life. Ebert was born in Los Angeles in 1978, the son of Michael Ebert, a psychotherapist. His mother, Lisa Richards, is an actress. His father would often take the family on long car trips through the desert. On one such trip, his mother shot footage of his father chanting in the desert, cradling Alex's baby sister Gabi, which would one day become a part of the video for the Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros song \"Desert Song\". His grandfather Carl Ebert had been Intendant of Deutsche Oper, Berlin; he also was a famous Actor trained by Max Reinhardt. His full birth name is Alexander Michael Tahquitz Ebert. His father took one of his son's names, Tahquitz, from his favorite climbing rock. Alex later on discovered that the name means \"demon\" in a Native American language. As a teenager, he had a difficult and tumultuous relationship with his father. His father influenced young Alexander by playing him music by artists like Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson, and Johnny Cash. He also cites 60s R&B, Pavarotti, and Beethoven as influences, as well as his elementary school teacher, a woman from South Africa named Ruth. Alexander enjoyed listening to hip-hop as a teenager, and originally intended to be a rapper. Following a school project on Marlon Brando, Ebert developed an affection for film and cinematic studies. His mother supported his budding passion and Ebert consequently was enrolled in extracuricular filmmaking classes. After dropping out of college, Ebert directed a short film and wrote several screenplays. He attributes the revival of his interest in professional music to his childhood friends and excessive drug usage during that period of his life. Career. Ima Robot. After Ebert's band The Lucky 13's broke up, Ima Robot was formed in 1997 and it became successful in the early 2000s, signing with Virgin Records. Their first full-length album released on September 6, 2003, was self-titled \"Ima Robot\", and featured the singles \"Dynomite\" and \"Song #1\". On September 12, 2006, Ima Robot released their second album \"Monument to the Masses\" which featured the singles \"Creeps Me Out\" and \"Lovers in Captivity\". In April 2007, the band won their independence from Virgin Records and continued to work unsigned under the management of Alexis Rivera of Echo Park Records. The song \"Gangster\" premiered on the band's MySpace on April 15, 2008, with its lyrics posted in a blog entry by the band. In 2010 the band announced the upcoming release of their new albumn, \"Another Man's Treasure\", and released the song \"Ruthless\" on the Internet. They are now being represented by the Werewolf Heart label. Ebert was quoted as saying that \"most of the songs were recorded between two and four years ago\", but that he looks forward to making music with Tim Anderson and Filip Nikolic again. Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. After years of the Los Angeles party lifestyle and subsequent drug addiction, Ebert broke up with his then-girlfriend, moved out of his house, and spent some time in rehab. During this time, he developed Edward Sharpe, his alter ego. \"I don't want to put too much weight on it, because in some ways it's just a name that I came up with. But I guess if I look deeper, I do feel like I had lost my identity in general. I really didn't know what was going on or who I was anymore. Adopting another name helped me open up an avenue to get back.\" Ebert developed Sharpe into a messianic figure, saying \"He was sent down to Earth to kinda heal and save mankind, but he kept getting distracted by girls and falling in love.\" One such girl was the singer Jade Castrinos, whom he saw sitting on an outdoor bench and immediately knew he needed to have a relationship with her. Their resultant affair formed the seeds of what would become Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. They started writing music together, and became a part of the art and music collective The Masses, which was partially started by some seed money from the late Heath Ledger. While their relationship did not last, the group took off in a big way, and their group soon swelled to more than 10 members, some of whom had been Alex's friends since he was young. By the summer of 2009, they were touring the country. Their first album, \"Up from Below\", was released in July 2009. Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros appeared on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on May 10, 2012 promoting their next album entitled \"Here\", which was released on May 29, 2012.

       "1     William Orbit  William Orbit (born William Mark Wainwright, 15 December 1956) is an English musician, composer and record producer. In the early 1980s he formed synthpop act Torch Song with Laurie Mayer and Grant Gilbert. In 1987 he released the first of his Strange Cargo album series, containing ambient music. Towards the end of the 1990s Orbit started to work with bigger name artists, producing songs on \"Ray of Light\" and \"Music\" by Madonna, \"13\" and \"Think Tank\" by Blur and \"Saints and Sinners\" by All Saints. His work with Madonna led him to win three Grammys. He worked again with Madonna on her 2012 album \"MDNA\" producing six songs. Biography. 1956–1980: Early life & first work. William Orbit was born William Wainwright in London's East End in 1956. His mother, of Italian and Swedish descent, and his father, from Yorkshire, were both schoolteachers. He does not have a formal education, having left school at 15 and being entirely self-taught. Aged 16, and living in a squat in Norwich and working as a strawberry picker in the summer, he started to devote himself to guitar playing. Living in squats around Europe and working at various jobs, hotel kitchen worker, motorbike messenger, at a ladies shoes factory, as an accounts clerk (in the days before computers), a night shift worker at the old Heineken Brewery in Amsterdam, junior draftsman at a North Sea oil rig design company (he was 'creative' with his CV') and so on. In these early years he was creatively frustrated, with no means to bring his ideas to life. But an opportunity to work as an assistant at Basing Street Studios just off the Portobello Road in West London gave him a first glimpse into the world of recording. Aged 23, he met Laurie Mayer who had just moved into his squat in an abandoned primary school in Paddington. This semi-derelict Victorian edifice was the perfect environment for live music to flourish, with bands such as Throbbing Gristle frequently performing there. Meyer and Orbit held mini-festivals in the deserted classrooms and workshops of the old school. The building was also home to the Spanish Anarchist collective Centro Iberico. It was around that time, in 1980, that William was asked to model clothes for the designer Takeo Kikuchi in Tokyo and this experience opened his eyes to the world of fashion and the visual arts. On that same trip was also the young Hamish Bowles, now International Editor at Large for Vogue magazine. 1981–1993: Torch Song, production & remix work. Mayer and Orbit formed the band Torch Song. An experiment in audio cassette soundscapes that also included the graphic designer Neville Brody. They have been close friends and creative collaborators ever since, writing the melodic top line for Madonna's track \"Falling Free\" from her twelfth album \"MDNA\". Encouraged by Meyer's creative zeal, he went on to build a commercially viable recording studio in Little Venice called Guerilla Studios (later situated in Crouch End, North London) A variety of clients booked the facility, including:  The Cocteau Twins, Colour Box, Stewart Copeland, Belinda Carlisle, Etienne Daho, Howard Devoto, Erasure, The Fall, The Frank Chickens, Goldie and Metalheadz, Martin Gore, Kemistry and Storm, Laibach, Lords of the New Church, , S'Express, Gary Numan, Renegade Soundwave, Les Rita Mitsouko, Sting, The Swans, 23 Skidoo, The Waterboys, Jah Wobble, World Party / Karl Wallinger He began to create remixes for a long list of artists.

Remixed artists include: Prince, The Cure, Seal, Nitzer Ebb, Peter Gabriel, Depeche Mode, Seal & The Human League 1990–1992: Guerilla & Bassomatic. Orbit founded Guerilla Records at the beginning of the 90s, releasing vinyl discs from artists such as Leftfield, Underworld, Felix Da Housecat and DJ Pierre in the then-new genre of 'Progressive House', and hosting illegal rave parties in disused warehouses in Central London, before forming the band Bassomatic, Fascinating Rhythm being their biggest hit. 1993 onwards: Strange Cargo III & Madonna. Orbit then moved to California, living in the surfer haven of Hermosa Beach, and had a radio program on the Southern Californian radio station KCRW since he had always had a fascination for radio in all its forms. He also began recording his album Strange Cargo III, including the track 'Water From A Vine Leaf', written with his ex-girlfriend Beth Orton. After traveling the world, and encountering different cultures and worldviews, he met Madonna in New York in 1997 and they recorded her multi Grammy Award winning seventh album \"Ray of Light\". The two have remained friends since, and created tracks such as \"Beautiful Stranger\" (1999) and other tracks for her eighth album \"Music\" (2000). In 2012 William co-wrote and co-produced six tracks for her twelfth album \"MDNA\", including the song \"Masterpiece\", that won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song at the 69th Golden Globe Awards. He has said on many occasions that he remains truly grateful to Madonna for seeing what nobody else saw at the time, and giving him a global platform for his work. Since then he has written and recorded with a wide range of artists, from Andreas Scholl in the classical world, to Beck, Pink, The Cure, Kraftwerk (a project with Ralf Hütter), Blur (the album '13'), All Saints ('Pure Shores', 'Black Coffee', 'Dreams' and other songs), Katie Melua, Robbie Williams, Sugababes, Ricky Martin and the late Malcolm Mclaren.

He has created a series of classical renditions 'Pieces in a Modern Style', from which came 'Adagio For Strings, Ferry Corsten mix'. In 2007, Orbit composed an orchestral suite for full orchestra and choir, in nine movements. It debuted on 8 July 2007 with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester. DJ & Radio. Orbit deejays occasionally, with a hardcore techno set, in various locations around the world such as Paris, Tokyo, Thailand and Novosibirsk, Siberia. He has described his mission as 'to get everyone on their feet, despite what they usually listen to'.

       "1     George Jones  George Glenn Jones (September 12, 1931 – April 26, 2013) was an American musician, singer and songwriter who achieved international fame for his long list of hit records as well as his distinctive voice and phrasing. He is generally regarded as one of the greatest vocalists in the history of country music. Country music scholar Bill C. Malone writes, \"For the two or three minutes consumed by a song, Jones immerses himself so completely in its lyrics, and in the mood it conveys, that the listener can scarcely avoid becoming similarly involved.\" Merle Haggard wrote in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine that \"His voice was like a Stradivarius violin: one of the greatest instruments ever made.\" During his life, Jones had more than 150 hits during his career, both as a solo artist and in duets with other artists.  Jones was also infamous for his alcoholism, cocaine addiction, missed concert dates (which inspired the moniker \"No Show Jones\") and general unmanageability. Jones' alcoholism compromised his health and his marriages, including one to country singer Tammy Wynette. After his divorce from Wynette in 1975, Jones married his fourth wife, Nancy Sepulvada. Jones died in 2013, aged 81, from hypoxic respiratory failure. He is interred at Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Nashville. Early life. George Glenn Jones was born on September 12, 1931 in Saratoga, Texas, and was raised in Vidor, Texas, with his brother and five sisters. His father, George Washington Jones, worked in a shipyard and played harmonica and guitar while his mother, Clara, played piano in the Pentecostal Church on Sundays. During his delivery, one of the doctors dropped Jones and broke his arm. When he was seven, his parents bought a radio and he heard country music for the first time. Jones recalled to \"Billboard\" in 2006 that he would lay in bed with his parents on Saturday nights listening to the \"Grand Ole Opry\" and insist that his mother wake him if he fell asleep so he could hear Roy Acuff or Bill Monroe. In his autobiography \"I Lived To Tell It All\", Jones explains that the early death of his sister Ethel spurred on his father's drinking problem and, by all accounts, George Washington Jones could be physically and emotionally abusive to his wife and children when he drank. In the book \"George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend\", Bob Allen recounts how George Sr. would return home in the middle of the night with his cronies roaring drunk, wake up a terrified George Jr., and demand that he sing for them or face a beating. In a CMT program on Jones' life, country music historian Robert K. Oermann marveled, \"You would think that it would make him not a singer, because it was so abusively thrust on him. But the opposite happened; he became a chronic singer. He became someone who had to sing.\" In the same program, Jones admitted that he remained ambivalent and resentful towards his father up until the day he died and observed in his autobiography \"The Jones family makeup doesn't sit well with liquor...Daddy was an unusual drinker. He drank to excess but never while working, and he probably was the hardest working man I've ever known.\" His father bought him his first guitar at age nine and he learned his first chords and songs at church and there are several photographs of a young George busking on the streets of Beaumont.  He left home at 16 and went to Jasper, Texas, where he sang and played on the KTXJ radio station with fellow musician Dalton Henderson. From there, he worked at the KRIC radio station. During one such afternoon show, Jones met his idol, Hank Williams (\"I just stared,\" he later wrote). In the 1989 video documentary \"Same Ole Me\", Jones admitted, \"I couldn't think or eat nothin' unless it was Hank Williams, and I couldn't wait for his next record to come out. He had to be, really, the greatest.\" He married his first wife Dorothy Bonvillion in 1950, but they divorced in 1951. He was enlisted in the United States Marine Corps until his discharge in 1953. The Korean War was underway, and he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He was stationed in San Jose, California for his entire service.  Starday & Mercury Years (1954-1962). Jones married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. His first record, the self-penned \"No Money in This Deal\", appeared in February 1954 on Starday Records and began the singer's association with producer and mentor H.W. \"Pappy\" Dailey. The song was actually cut in Jack Starnes' living room (Starnes formed Starday Records with Daily). Jones also worked at KRTM in Beaumont around this time. Deejay Gordon Baxter told Nick Tosches that Jones acquired the nickname \"possum\" while working there: \"One of the deejays there, Slim Watts, took to calling him George P. Willicker Picklepuss Possum Jones. For one thing, he cut his hair short, like a possum's belly. He had a possum's nose and stupid eyes, like a possum.\" During his early recording sessions, Daily admonished Jones for attempting to sound too much like his heroes Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell. Jones' first hit came with \"Why Baby Why\" in 1955. That same year, while touring as a cast member of the \"Louisiana Hayride\", Jones met and played shows with Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. \"I didn't get to know him that well,\" Jones said of Presley to Nick Tosches in 1994. \"He stayed pretty much with his friends around him in his dressing room. Nobody seemed to get around him much any length of time to talk to him.\" Jones would, however, remain lifelong friends with Johnny Cash. Jones was invited to sing at the \"Grand Ole Opry\" in 1956.  With Presley's explosion in popularity in 1956, pressure was put on Jones to cut a few rockabilly sides and he reluctantly agreed. His heart was never in it, however, and he quickly regretted the decision; in his autobiography he joked, \"During the years, when I've encountered those records, I've used them for Frisbees.\" He explained to \"Billboard\" in 2006: \"I was desperate. When you're hungry, a poor man with a house full of kids, you're gonna do some things you ordinarily wouldn't do. I said, 'Well, hell, I'll try anything once.' I tried \"Dadgum It How Come It\" and \"Rock It\", a bunch of shit. I didn't want my name on the rock and roll thing, so I told them to put Thumper Jones on it and if it did something, good, if it didn't, hell, I didn't want to be shamed with it.\" Jones went on to say he unsuccessfully attempted to buy all the masters to keep the cuts from surfacing later, which they did. Jones moved to Mercury in 1957. In 1959, he had his first number one on the Billboard country chart with \"White Lightnin'\", ironically a more authentic rock and roll sound than his half-hearted rockabilly cuts. In the \"Same Ole Me\" retrospective, Johnny Cash insisted, \"George Jones woulda been a really hot rockabilly artist if he'd approached it from that angle. Well, \"he was\", really, but never got the credit for it.\" \"White Lightnin'\" was written by J.P. Richardson, better known as the Big Bopper. In \"I Lived To Tell It All\", Jones confessed that he showed up for the recording session under the influence of a great deal of alcohol and it took him approximately 80 takes just to record his vocals. To make matters worse, Buddy Killen, who played the upright bass on the recording, was reported as having severely blistered fingers from having to play his bass part 80 times. Killen not only threatened to quit the session, but also threatened to physically harm Jones for the painful consequences of Jones' drinking. On the final vocal take used on the recording Jones slurs the word \"slug\", something he would mimic in live performances of the song.  One aspect of Jones' early career that is often overlooked is his success as a songwriter; he wrote or co-wrote many of his biggest hits during this period, several of which have become standards, like \"The Window Up Above\" (later a smash for Mickey Gilley in 1975) and \"Seasons Of My Heart\" (a hit for Johnny Cash and also recorded by Willie Nelson and Jerry Lee Lewis). Jones wrote \"Just One More\" (also recorded by Cash), \"Life To Go\" (a top five hit for Stonewall Jackson in 1959), \"You Gotta Be My Baby\" and \"Don't Stop The Music\" on his own and had a hand in writing \"Color Of The Blues\" (covered by Elvis Costello), \"Tender Years\" and \"Tall Tall Trees\" (co-written with Roger Miller). Jones' most frequent songwriting collaborator was his childhood friend Darrell Edwards. United Artists Years (1962-1964). Jones signed with United Artists in 1962 and immediately scored one of the biggest hits of his career, \"She Thinks I Still Care\". His voice had grown noticeably deeper during this period and he began cultivating the singing style that became uniquely his own. During his stint with UA, Jones recorded tribute albums to Hank Williams and Bob Wills and cut an album of duets with Melba Montgomery, including the hit \"We Must Have Been Out Of Our Minds\". Jones was also well on his way to gaining a reputation as a notorious hell-raiser. In his \"Rolling Stone\" tribute Merle Haggard recalls, \"I met him at the Blackboard Café in Bakersfield, California, which was the place to go in '61. He was already famous for not showing up or showing up drunk, and he showed up drunk. I was onstage - I think I was singing Marty Robbins' \"Devil Woman\" - and he kicked the doors of the office open and said 'Who the fuck is that?' It was one the greatest compliments of my entire life when George Jones said I was his favorite country singer...In 1967, I released a ballad called \"I Threw Away The Rose\" and he was so impressed he actually jumped ship and left his tour, rented a Lear Jet and came to Amarillo, Texas. He told me my low note changed his life. He also folded my steel guitarist Fuzzy Owen in a rollaway bed and rolled him out on the street. That was the pinnacle.\" Former president of Starday Records Don Pierce told director Mark Hall in 1989 another famous story about Jones after Pappy Daily bailed him out of the drunk tank and got him a gig in Houston for $2,500. The next day Jones came to Dailey's office broke again. According to Pierce, an irritated Dailey said, \"Well, George, you just made $2,500 but I talked to some of the guys you were out partying with and they said you went and flushed it down the toilet.\" \"Pappy, that's a damn lie!\" Jones shot back. \"It wasn't but $1,200.\"  On tour Jones was always backed by the Jones Boys. Like Buck Owens' Buckaroos and Merle Haggard's Strangers, Jones worked with many musicians who were great talents in their own right. These included Dan Schafer, Hank Singer, Brittany Allyn, Sonny Curtis, Kent Goodson, Bobby Birkhead, and Steve Hinson. In the 1980s and 1990s, bass player Ron Gaddis served as the Jones Boys' bandleader and sang harmony with George in concert. Lorrie Morgan (who was once married to Gaddis) also toured as a backup singer for Jones in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Johnny Paycheck was the Jones Boys' bass player in the 1960s before going on to his own stardom in the 1970s.  Musicor Years (1964-1971). In 1964, Pappy Daily secured a new contract with Musicor records. For the rest of the 1960s, Jones would only score one number one (1967's \"Walk Through This World With Me\") but he practically owned the country music charts throughout the decade. Significant hits include \"Love Bug\" (a nod to Buck Owens and the Bakersfield sound), \"Things Have Gone To Pieces\", \"The Race Is On\", \"My Favorite Lies\", \"I'll Share My World With You\", \"Take Me\" (a song he co-wrote and would later record with Tammy Wynette), \"A Good Year For The Roses\" and \"If My Heart Had Windows\". By this point, Jones' singing style had evolved from the full-throated, high lonesome sound of Hank Williams and Roy Acuff on his early Starday records to the more refined, subtle style of Lefty Frizzell. In a 2006 interview with \"Billboard\", Jones acknowledged the Texan's influence on his idiosyncratic phrasing: \"I got that from Lefty. He always made five syllables out of one damn word.\"  Jones' binge drinking and use of amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 and he had to be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. He later described his thoughts: \"There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken an hour and a half or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did.\" Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight\" by Hank Williams, Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for \"One More Last Chance\" by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single \"Honky Tonk Song\" in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography \"Stand By Your Man\", Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: \"I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’\"  Tammy Wynette. Jones became aware of Tammy Wynette because their tours were booked by the same agency and their paths sometimes crossed after Wynette's first minor hit \"Apartment #9\" in 1966. Wynette was married to songwriter Don Chapel, who was also the opening act for her shows at the time. The three became friends but eventually Jones took more than a passing fancy to Wynette, who was eleven years his junior and grew up listening to all of his records. According to his autobiography, Jones went to their house for supper and while she was fixing the meal Wynette and Chapel got into a heated exchange with Chapel calling his wife \"a son of a bitch\". Jones wrote: \"I felt rage fly all over me. I jumped from my chair, put my hands under the dinner table, and flipped it over. Dishes, utensils, and glasses flew in all directions. Don's and Tammy's eyes got about as big as the flying dinner plates.\" Jones professed his love for Wynette on the spot and the couple were married in 1969. They began touring together and Jones bought out his contract with Musicor so he could record with Tammy and her producer Billy Sherrill on Epic Records (the singer had split with longtime producer Pappy Daily on acrimonious terms). Jones and Wynette became known as \"Mr. & Mrs. Country Music\" in the early 70s, scoring several big hits, including \"We're Gonna Hold On,\" \"Let's Build A World Together\", \"Golden Ring\", \"Near You\" and \"(We're Not) The Jet Set\". In October 1970, shortly after the birth of their only child Tamala Georgette, Jones was straightjacketed and committed to a padded cell at the Watson Clinic in Lakeland, Florida after a drunken bender; he was kept there to detoxify for ten days before being released with a prescription for Librium. Jones managed longer stretches of sobriety with Wynette than he had enjoyed in years but as the decade wore on his drinking and erratic behavior worsened, leading to the couple's divorce in 1976. Jones accepted the responsibility for the failure of the marriage but vehemently denied Wynette's allegations in her autobiography that he beat her and fired a shotgun at her.  Remarkably, Jones and Wynette continued playing shows and drawing crowds in the years after their divorce, as fans began to see their songs mirroring their stormy relationship. In 1980, they recorded the album \"Together Again\" and scored a hit with \"Two Story House\". Jones also spoke publicly about his hopes for a reconciliation and would jokingly reference Tammy in some of his songs - during performances of his 1981 hit \"If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me (Her Memory Will)\" he would sing \"Tammy's memory will\" - but the recrimination continued unabated. After years of sniping, Jones and Wynette appeared to make peace in the 1990s, recording a final album, \"One\", and even touring together again before Wynette's death in 1998. 1970s. Jones pairing with Billy Sherrill at Epic Records came as a surprise to many; Sherrill and business partner Glenn Sutton are regarded as the defining influences of the countrypolitan sound, a smooth amalgamation of pop and country music that was popular during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, a far cry from what was George's honky tonk roots. Despite a shaky start, the success that Sherrill had with Jones proved to be his most enduring; although Billboard chart statistics show that Sherrill had his biggest commercial successes with artists such as Wynette and Charlie Rich, with Jones, Sherrill had his most longest-lasting association. In 1974, they scored a number one hit with \"The Door\" (\"I've heard the sound of my dear old mother cryin'/and the sound of the train that took me off to war\") and followed that in 1975 with \"The Grand Tour\". Unlike most singers who might have been overwhelmed by the string arrangements and background vocalists Sherrill sometimes employed on his records, Jones' voice, with its at times frightening intensity and lucid tone, could stand up to anything. While Jones wrote fewer songs himself - songwriters had been tripping over themselves pitching songs to him for years - he still managed to co-write several, such as \"What My Woman Can't Do\" (covered by Jerry Lee Lewis), \"A Drunk Can't Be A Man\", the harrowing \"I Just Don't Give A Damn\" (perhaps the greatest \"lost classic\" in the entire Jones catalogue)  and \"These Days (I Barely Get By)\", which he had written with Wynette. In the late seventies, Jones spiraled out of control. Already drinking constantly, a manager named Shug Baggot introduced him to cocaine before a show because he was too tired to perform. The drug would increase Jones' already considerable paranoia. During one drunken binge he shot at, and very nearly hit, his friend and occasional songwriting partner Earl \"Peanutt\" Montgomery after Montgomery had quit drinking after finding religion. He was often penniless and acknowledged in his autobiography that Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash came to his financial aid during this time. Jones also began missing shows at an alarming rate and lawsuits from promoters started piling up. In 1978, owing Wynette $36,000 in child support and claiming to be one million dollars in debt, he filed for bankruptcy. Jones appeared incoherent at times, speaking in quarrelling voices that he would later call \"the Duck\" and \"the Old Man\". In his article \"The Devil In George Jones\", Nick Tosches states, \"By February 1979 he was homeless, deranged, and destitute, living in his car and barely able to digest the junk food on which he subsisted. He weighed under a hundred pounds, and his condition was so bad that it took him more than two years to complete \"My Very Special Guests\", an album on which Willie Nelson, Linda Ronstadt, Elvis Costello, and other famous fans came to his vocal aid and support. Jones entered Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Upon his release in January 1980, the first thing he did was pick up a six-pack.\"  Jones often displayed a sheepish, self-deprecating sense of humor regarding his dire financial standing and bad reputation. In June 1979, he appeared with Waylon Jennings on Ralph Emery's syndicated radio program and at one point Jennings cracked, \"It's lonely at the top.\" A laughing Jones replied, \"It's lonely at the bottom, too! It's real, real lonely, Waylon.\" Despite his chronic unreliability, Jones was still capable of putting on a captivating live show. On Independence Day, 1976, he appeared at Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic in Gonzales, Texas in front of 80,000 younger, country rock oriented fans. A nervous Jones felt out of his comfort zone and nearly bolted from the festival but went on anyway and wound up stealing the show. \"The Houston Post\" wrote, \"He was the undisputed star of this year's Willie Nelson picnic...one of the greatest.\" \"Penthouse\" called him \"...the spirit of country music, plain and simple, its Holy Ghost\". \"The Village Voice\" added \"As a singer he is as intelligent as they come, and should be considered for a spot in America's all-time top ten.\" Jones began missing more shows than he made, however, including several highly publicized dates at the Bottom Line club in New York. Former vice president of CBS Records Rick Blackburn recalls in the 1989 video \"Same Ole Me\" that the event had been hyped for weeks, with a lot of top press and cast members from \"Saturday Night Live\" planning to attend. \"We'd made our plans, travel arrangements and so forth. George excused himself from my office, left - and we didn't see him for three weeks. He just \"did not show up\".\" Much like Hank Williams, Jones seemed suspicious of success and furiously despised perceived slights and condescension directed towards the music that he loved so dearly. When he finally played the Bottom Line in 1980, the \"New York Times\" called him \"the finest, most riveting singer in country music.\" Part of Jones appeal as a live performer was his ability to get a song across; unlike some other country singers of the day, who might smile or wink as they sang a \"tearjerker\", Jones would look authentically depressed during the performance, casting his eyes down to the floor or smiling sadly when the lyric called for it. He Stopped Loving Her Today. It is remarkable, considering how he abused himself, that Jones' vocal prowess improved rather than disintegrated during this period. Nonetheless, by 1980 he had not had a number one single in six years and many critics began to write him off. However, Jones stunned the music industry in April when \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" was released and shot to number one on the country charts, remaining there for 18 weeks. The song was written by Bobby Braddock and Curly Putnam and tells the story of a friend who has never given up on his love; he keeps old letters and photos from back in the day and hangs on to hope that she would \"come back again.\" The song reaches its peak in the chorus, revealing that he indeed stopped loving her when he passed away. The woman does return - for his funeral. In a lesser singer's hands, the song might have sounded corny or even comical but Jones' interpretation, buoyed by his brilliant delivery of the line \"...first time I'd seen him smile in years\", gives it a mournful, gripping realism. When it began being played on the radio in the spring of 1980 just about everyone who heard it was floored. It is consistently voted as the greatest country song of all time, along with \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" by Hank Williams and \"Crazy\" by Patsy Cline.  According to producer Billy Sherrill and Jones himself, the singer hated the song when he first heard it. In Bob Allen's biography of the singer, Sherrill states, \"He thought it was too long, too sad, too depressing and that nobody would ever play it...He hated the melody and wouldn't learn it.\" Sherrill also claims that Jones frustrated him by continually singing the song to the melody of the Kris Kristofferson hit \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\". In the \"Same Ole Me\" retrospective, Sherrill recalls a heated exchange during one recording session: \"I said 'That's not the melody!' and he said 'Yeah, but it's a better melody.' I said 'It might be - Kristofferson would think so too, it's his melody!'\" In the same documentary, Sherrill claims that Jones was in such bad physical shape during this period that \"the recitation was recorded 18 months after the first verse was\" and added that the last words Jones said about \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" was \"Nobody'll buy that morbid son of a bitch\". A big part of Jones' success over the years was that he could always smell a hit but this time his instincts were woefully off. Although he had disliked \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" when it was first offered to him, Jones ultimately gave the song credit for reviving his flagging career, stating that \"a four-decade career had been salvaged by a three-minute song.\" Jones earned the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1980. The Academy of Country Music awarded the song Single of the Year and Song of the Year in 1980. It also became the Country Music Association's Song of the Year in both 1980 and 1981. 1980s. The success of \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" led CBS Records to renew Jones' recording contract and sparked new interest in the singer. He was the subject of an hour-and-a-quarter long HBO television special entitled \"George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends\", which saw the painfully wan singer performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" obviously inebriated; his condition was readily apparent when he slurred the words to \"I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool\" with Barbara Mandrell on a televised broadcast. He was involved in several high speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' Jekyll & Hyde persona when drinking, with the singer looking genuinely frightening as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, \"One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune.\" In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of \"The Village Voice\", \"I don't show a lot of affection. I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. I saved it all for the songs. I didn't know you were suppose to show that love person to person. I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. The only way I could would be to do it in a song.\" In 1982, Jones recorded the album \"A Taste of Yesterday's Wine\" with Merle Haggard. While the album cover was shocking, with Jones looking gaunt and wasted, his singing was flawless. His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting \"I'm Not Ready Yet\", \"Same Ole Me (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)\", \"Still Doin' Time\", \"Tennessee Whiskey\", \"We Didn't See A Thing\" (a duet with Ray Charles) and \"I Always Get Lucky With You\", which was Jones' last number one in 1984. In 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvada, a 34 year old divorcée from Mansfield, Louisiana. Sepulvada's positive impact on Jones' life and career cannot be overestimated; she eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, \"He was drinking but he was fun to be around. It wasn't love at first sight or anything like that. But I saw what a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn't help caring about him.\" Jones managed to quit cocaine but went on a drunken rampage in Alabama in the fall of 1983 and was once again straightjacketed and committed to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions. But by this time, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did want to quit drinking. In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama - at the age of 52 - Jones performed his first stone cold sober show since the early seventies. \"All my life it seems like I've been running from something,\" he told the United Press International in June. \"If I knew what it was, maybe I could run in the right direction. But I always seem to end up going the other way.\" Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with \"No Show Jones\", a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling \"Billboard\" in 2006, \"Now I know it hurt my fans in a way and I've always been sad about that, it really bothered me for a long time.\"  Mostly sober for the rest of the 1980s, Jones consistently released albums with Sherrill producing, including \"Shine On\", \"Jones Country\", \"You've Still Got A Place In My Heart\", \"Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes\", \"Wine Colored Roses\" (an album Jones would tell Jolene Downs in 2001 was one of his personal favorites), \"Too Wild Too Long\" and \"One Woman Man\". Jones' video for his 1985 hit \"Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes won the CMA award for Video of the Year (Billy Sherrill makes a cameo as the bus driver).  Later years. In 1990, Jones released his last proper studio album on Epic, \"You Oughta Be Here With Me\". Although the album featured several stirring performances, including the lead single \"Hell Stays Open All Night Long\" and the Roger Miller-penned title song, the single bombed and Jones made the switch to MCA, ending his relationship with Sherrill and what was now Sony Music after 19 years. His first album with MCA, \"And Along Came Jones\", was released in 1991 and, backed by MCA's powerful promotion team and producer Kyle Lehning (who had produced a string of hit albums for Randy Travis), the album sold better than his previous one had. However, two singles, \"You Couldn't Get The Picture\" and \"She Loved A Lot In Her Time\" (a tribute to Jones' mother Clara), did not crack the top 30 on the charts as Jones lost favor with country radio as the format was altered radically during the early 1990s. His last album to have significant radio airplay was 1992's \"Walls Can Fall\", which featured the novelty song \"Finally Friday\" and \"I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair,\" a testament to his continued vivaciousness in old age. Despite the loss of radio airplay, Jones continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame by Randy Travis in 1992. In 1996, Jones released his autobiography \"I Lived To Tell It All\" with Tom Carter and the irony of his long career was not lost on him, with the singer writing in its preface, \"I also know that a lot of my show-business peers are going to be angry after reading this book. So many have worked so hard to maintain their careers. I never took my career seriously, and yet it's flourishing.\" He also pulled no punches about his disappointment in the direction country music had taken, devoting a full chapter to the changes in the country music scene of the 1990s that saw him removed from radio playlists in favor of a younger generation of pop-influenced country stars. Despite his absence from the country charts during this time, latter-day country superstars such as Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, and many others often paid tribute to Jones while expressing their love and respect for his legacy as a true country legend who paved the way for their own success. On February 17, 1998, The Nashville Network premiered a group of television specials called \"The George Jones Show\", with Jones as host. The program featured informal chats with Jones holding court with country's biggest stars old and new and, of course, music. Guests included Loretta Lynn, Trace Adkins, Johnny Paycheck, Lorrie Morgan, Merle Haggard, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Charley Pride, Bobby Bare, Patty Loveless and Waylon Jennings, among others.  While Jones remained committed to \"pure country\", he worked with the top producers and musicians of the day and the quality of his work remained high. Some significant performances include \"I Must Have Done Something Bad\", \"Wild Irish Rose\", \"Billy B. Bad\" (a sarcastic jab at country music establishment trendsetters), \"A Thousand Times A Day\", \"When The Last Curtain Falls\" and the novelty \"High-Tech Redneck\". Jones most popular song in his later years was \"Choices\", the first single from his 1999 album \"Cold Hard Truth\". Although written by Mike Curtis, Billy Yates and Rob Lyons and recorded first by Yates on his 1997 self-titled album, the song was a perfect fit for Jones, who lived every word of it. A video was also made for the song and Jones won another Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. The song was at the center of controversy when the Country Music Association invited Jones to perform it on the awards show, but required that he perform an abridged version. Jones refused and did not attend the show. Alan Jackson was disappointed with the association's decision and halfway through his own performance during the show he signaled to his band and played part of Jones' song in protest. On March 6, 1999, Jones was involved in an accident when he crashed his sport utility vehicle near his home. He was rushed to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he was released two weeks later. In May of that year, Jones pleaded guilty to drunk driving charges related to the accident. The crash was a significant turning point, as he explained to \"Billboard\" in 2006: \"...when I had that wreck I made up my mind, it put the fear of God in me. No more smoking, no more drinking. I didn't have to have no help, I made up my mind to quit. I don't crave it.\" The fact that Jones survived the accident - the 67 year old singer suffered a punctured lung and lacerations to his liver - renewed his spiritual faith and he went on to release \"The Gospel Collection\" in 2003, which Billy Sherrill came out of retirement to produce. He appeared at a televised Johnny Cash Memorial Concert in 2003, singing \"Big River\" with Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. In 2008, Jones received the Kennedy Center Honor along with Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey of The Who, Barbara Streisand, Morgan Freeman and Twyla Twerp. President George W. Bush disclosed that he had many of Jones' songs on his iPod. Jones also served as judge in 2008 for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers. and \"Rolling Stone\" named him number 43 in their 100 Greatest Singers of All Time issue. An album titled \"Hits I Missed And One I Didn't\", in which he covered hits he had passed on as well as a remake of his own \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\", would be released as his final studio album. In 2012, Jones received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement award. On March 29, 2012, Jones was hospitalized with an upper respiratory infection. Months later, on May 21, Jones was hospitalized again for his infection and was released five days later. On August 14, 2012, Jones announced his farewell tour, the Grand Tour, with scheduled stops at 60 cities. Jones was scheduled to perform his final concert at the Bridgestone Arena on November 22, 2013. However, on April 18, 2013, Jones was hospitalized for a slight fever and irregular blood pressure. His concerts in Alabama and Salem were postponed as a result. Death & funeral. Jones died in the early morning hours of April 26, 2013, aged 81, from hypoxic respiratory failure at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Former first lady Laura Bush was among those eulogizing Jones at his funeral on May 2, 2013. Other speakers were Tennessee governor Bill Haslam, news personality Bob Schieffer, and country singers Barbara Mandrell and Kenny Chesney. Alan Jackson, Kid Rock, Ronnie Milsap, Randy Travis, Vince Gill, Patty Loveless, Travis Tritt, the Oak Ridge Boys, Charlie Daniels, Wynonna and Brad Paisley provided musical tributes The service was broadcast live on CMT, GAC, RFD-TV, The Nashville Network and Family Net as well as Nashville stations. SiriusXM and WSM 650AM, home of the Grand Ole Opry, broadcast the event on the radio. The family has asked that contributions be made to the Grand Ole Opry Trust Fund or to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. Jones death made headlines all over the world; many country stations abandoned their playlists and played his songs throughout the day. The week after Jones's death, \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" re-entered the hot country songs at number 21. Legacy. Part of the reason Jones was such an emotive interpreter of country music may have been because he simply loved the music more than anyone else; he tirelessly defended its integrity. \"It's never been for the love of money,\" he told \"Billboard\" in 2006. \"I thank God for it because it makes me a living. But I sing because I love it, not because of the dollar signs.\" Jones also went out of his way to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was. \"Everybody knows he's a great singer,\" Alan Jackson stated in 1995, \"but what I like most about George is that when you meet him, he is like some ole guy that works down at the gas station...even though he's a legend!\" Jones influence as a singer is beyond question. Shortly after his passing, Andrew Mueller wrote in \"Uncut\", \"He was one of the finest interpretive singers who ever lifted a microphone...There cannot be a single country songwriter of the last 50-odd years who has not wondered what it might be like to hear their words sung by that voice.\" In 1994, country music historian Colin Escott pronounced, \"Contemporary country music is virtually founded on reverence for George Jones. Walk through a room of country singers and conduct a quick poll, George nearly always tops it.\" In the liner notes to \"Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country\" Richard Kienzle confirms, \"Jones sings of people and stories that are achingly human. He can turn a ballad into a catharsis by wringing every possible emotion from it, making it a primal, strangled cry of anguish\". In a quote that appeared on the sleeve of Jones' 1976 album \"Memories Of Us\", Emmylou Harris wrote, \"...when you hear George Jones sing, you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art - always.\" In \"Same Ole Me\", several country music stars offer similar thoughts: Johnny Cash: \"When people ask me who my favorite country singer is, I say, 'You mean besides George Jones?'\"; Randy Travis: \"It sounds like he's lived every minute of every word that he sings and there's very few people who can do that\"; Waylon Jennings: \"If we could all sound like we wanted to we'd all sound like George Jones.; Tom T. Hall: \"It was always Jones who got the message across just right\"; and Roy Acuff: \"I'd give anything if I could sing like George Jones\". In the same documentary, producer Billy Sherrill states, \"All I did was change the instrumentation around him. I don't think he's changed \"at all\".\" Jones dedication to what he called \"hardcore country music\" remained resolute until the day he died.  Influence Beyond Country Music. Unlike some of his contemporaries, Jones stuck with country music with a vengeance. Ironically, without even trying, Jones' unabashed loyalty to strictly country arrangements attracted the admiration of musicians and songwriters from a wide range of genres. In an often-quoted tribute, Frank Sinatra called Jones \"the second best singer in America\". In a \"Rolling Stone\" interview in 1969, Bob Dylan was asked what he thought was the best song released in the previous year and he replied, \"George Jones had one called 'Small Town Laboring Man'.\" In his autobiography \"Chronicles\", Dylan states that in the early 1960s he was largely unimpressed by what he heard on the radio and admits \"Outside of maybe George Jones, I didn't listen to country music either.\" Country rock pioneer Gram Parsons was an avid George Jones fan and covered Jones' song \"That's All It Took\" on his first solo album. In the documentary \"Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel\", Pamela des Barres recalls seeing Parsons singing Jones' song \"She Once Lived Here\" at an empty Whiskey A Go Go in Los Angeles: \"It was my peak, \"peak\" moment, not sitting on Jimmy Page's amp...that was my peak moment.\" Parsons reignited Keith Richards' interest in country music in the early seventies and after Jones' death in 2013 the guitarist wrote, \"He possessed the most touching voice, the most expressive ways of projecting that beautiful instrument of anyone I can call to mind. You heard his heart in every note he sang.\" Richards recorded \"Say It's Not You\" with Jones for \"The Bradley Barn Sessions\" in 1994 and recalls in his autobiography hearing him sing for the first time when the Rolling Stones and Jones were on the same show in Texas in 1964: \"They trailed in with tumbleweed following them, as if tumbleweed was their pet. Dust all over the place, a bunch of cowboys. But when George got up, we went whoa, there's a master up there.\" In an interview for the 1989 Rolling Stones documentary \"25x5\", Mick Jagger also cites Jones as one of his favorite country singers. John Prine mentions Jones in his song \"Jesus the Missing Years\". Jones fan Elvis Costello had a surprise hit in the UK when he covered \"A Good Year For The Roses\" in 1981. Elliott Smith told an interviewer about his idea of Heaven: \"George Jones would be singing all the time. It would be like New York in reverse: people would be nice to each other for no reason at all, and it would smell good.\" In a 2001 interview with Mark Binelli from \"Rolling Stone\", Leonard Cohen asked, \"Have you heard George Jones' last record \"Cold Hard Truth\"? I love to hear an old guy lay out his situation. He has the best voice in America.\" The day Jones died, Cohen performed \"Choices\" on stage in Winnipeg, Canada as a tribute to the country legend. In 2013, Robbie Robertson told \"Uncut\", \"He was the Ray Charles of country music - the one who could make you cry with his voice...We wouldn't listen to country music, the guys in the Band, but we'd listen to George Jones...\" James Taylor, who wrote \"Bartenders Blues\" with Jones in mind and sang background vocals with him on the recording, told \"Rolling Stone\", \"He sounds like a steel guitar. It's the way he blends notes, the way he comes up to them, the way he crescendos and decrescendos. The dynamic of it is very tight and very controlled - it's like carving with the voice.\" Other disparate artists who recorded with Jones include Dennis Locorriere and Ray Sawyer of Dr. Hook, Mark Knopfler, the Staples Singers, Leon Russell, B.B King and Linda Ronstadt. In 1995, Burt Reynolds wrote, \"He is to country music what Spencer Tracy is to movies.\" On the day of his passing, Nathan Followill of the alternative rock band Kings of Leon tweeted, \"RIP, George Jones, you'll be sorely missed. One of the all time greats.\"  Duets. Jones was one of the greatest harmony singers in country music and released many duets over the course of his long career. While his songs with Tammy Wynette are his most celebrated, Jones claimed in his autobiography that he felt his duets with Melba Montgomery were his best. Jones also recorded duet albums with Gene Pitney and his former bass player Johnny Paycheck. George's record with Paycheck, 1980's \"Double Trouble\", is one of his most atypical records and features him giving credible performances on numbers like \"Maybelline\", \"You Better Move On\", and \"Proud Mary\". Jones also recorded the duet albums \"My Very Special Guests\" (1979), \"Ladies Choice\" (1984), \"Friends In High Places\" (1991), \"The Bradley Barn Sessions\" (1994), \"God's Country: George Jones And Friends\" (2006), a second album with Merle Haggard called \"Kickin' Out The Footlights...Again\" (2006) and \"Burn Your Playhouse Down\" (2008). Some notable duets Jones recorded include: Personal Life. Jones married his first wife, Dorothy Bonvillion, in 1950 and had one daughter, Susan. In 1989, Jones admitted in the \"Same Ole Me\" retrospective, \"I had my first daughter by my first wife and, to be honest with you, that's the main reason I went into the service, because I couldn't pay my child support.\" He had two sons, Jeffery and Brian, with his second wife Shirley; he suffered a strained relationship with them, no doubt in part because of his extended absences, drinking and erratic personal behavior. In 2008, Jones recorded \"You And Me And Time\" with his daughter by Tammy, Tamala Georgette. In 2011,Georgette published a book, \"The Three Of Us: Understanding My Mother, Finding My Father, and Growing Up with George and Tammy\". Jones was reportedly unhappy about the book. \n",

He had been in a band called Diversion and also had a solo career, including the album \"Soul'd Out\". Chris auditioned for the first season of \"The X Factor USA\" with one of his original compositions \"Young Homie\" and was one of the finalists during season one, with L.A. Reid as his mentor. He finished third overall in the competition, behind winner Melanie Amaro and runner-up Josh Krajcik. He is most popular in New Zealand, with his single \"Young Homie\" reaching number one in the New Zealand charts. Early life. Christopher Rene was born to Joan René (née Sampson) and Rafael Leon \"Googie\" René. His father was a songwriter and jazz pianist in the 1950s and 1960s, and he has two brothers, Mike and Gabriel, and a sister, Gina.

A heavily tattooed man, he has a tattoo that reads \"Believe\" on his arm, and the tattoos \"Love\" and \"Life\" on his fingers. Rene says, \"I've been influenced by every kind of music you can think of, from Mozart to Led Zeppelin to Outkast. I love Al Green, I love punk rock--just anything that's got that crazy passion.\" Music career. 1993-2002: Diversion. Diversion was Rene's first musical alliance; an alternative pop band based in Soquel, California (1994–2002) composed of Tas Szemeredi (vox/bass), Chris Rene (guitar/vox), and Mike Rene (drums). They were only 12 or 13 years old when they formed the band, but still managed to perform at well known venues such as the Red Room. Diversion was one of the young alternative pop bands in Santa Cruz.  Diversion released a self-titled CD, \"Diversion\", in 2000. The band recorded some more tracks for a second album, but they broke up in early 2005 without being able to finish it. 2003-2009: Solo career. The band continued working on music for their second album until 2005, but never saw the project through. After split-up of the band, Chris Rene began writing and recording music as an individual. He continued to work as a solo artist and in 2009, released the album \"Soul'd Out\" on an independent label. 2011: The X Factor. On September 21, 2011, Rene auditioned by singing one of his original songs entitled \"Young Homie\" getting a standing ovation from the audience and four \"yeses\" from the judges. Judge Simon Cowell said of his audition \"...always my favorite feeling in the world...is when I sit in this chair and I meet a star for the first time\". Cowell was not the only judge to praise Rene; L.A Reid stated, \"I've worked with some of the greatest hip-hop artists, from Jay-Z to Kanye West, and all of my boys, they would be proud of me today to tell you that you are the truth.\" During the competition, he performed two of his original compositions (lyrics and music). They were \"Young Homie\" (during auditions, week 5 of the live shows and his performance in the final) and \"Where Do We Go from Here\" (in week 7 of the live shows, on December 7, 2011). He also sang a mix of \"Let It Be\"/\"Young Homie\" on November 22, 2011 in Week 5 of the live shows of the series, and also in the Final of the show. 2012–present: After \"The X Factor\". L.A. Reid has confirmed that Rene has started recording music for a post-\"The X Factor\" album.  On January 17, 2012, it was confirmed that Rene has signed with a joint venture between Syco and Epic Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment.

Rene is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, who revealed he had just been out of rehab at Janus Rehabilitation Center of Santa Cruz, and had been clean for just ten weeks before taking part in \"The X Factor\" auditions. His song \"Young Homie\" is \"about learning how to be a grown-up,\" says Rene. \"When you're young, you feel like there's no limit, no consequences to your actions. So it's me talking to my younger self and to all the young brothers out there, telling them that life's too beautiful to live like that.\" While the song contains a heavy subject matter, it is reflective of Rene's personal life. Rene plays piano, guitar, bass, drums, among others. He began writing songs and playing guitar at age 12, teaching himself the pentatonic scale and beyond.  Rene has a five-year-old son, Ryan (born August 30, 2008), whom he fathered with his longtime girlfriend Melissa. He also has another son, a six-year-old named Elijah. For the first two years of Elijah's life, Rene didn't know about him. The child is in foster care, but was told Rene is his biological father. Rene talks to both of his sons everyday and sees them when he is home in Santa Cruz.  Rene is the grandson of Leon René, a famous composer of R&B and rock and roll songs in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s and a founder of a number of record labels including \"Class\" and \"Rendezvous Record Company\".

       "1     Ol' Dirty Bastard  Russell Tyrone Jones (November 15, 1968Â â November 13, 2004), best known by his stage name Ol' Dirty Bastard (or ODB), was an American rapper and occasional producer. He was one of the founding members of the Wu-Tang Clan, a rap group primarily from Staten Island, New York that first rose to mainstream prominence with their 1993 debut album \"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\". After establishing the Wu-Tang Clan, Ol' Dirty Bastard went on to pursue a successful solo career and contributed as a rapper/producer for the Fugees. However, his professional success was hampered by frequent legal troubles, including incarceration. He died on November 13, 2004 of a drug overdose, two days before his 36th birthday. Prior to his death, Jones managed to record his third solo album, which has been repeatedly delayed and as of 2013 has not been released. Jones was often noted for his trademark microphone techniques and his \"outrageously profane, free-associative rhymes delivered in a distinctive half-rapped, half-sung style\". His stage name was derived from the 1980 martial arts film \"Ol' Dirty and the Bastard\" (also called \"An Old Kung Fu Master\", starring Simon \"Ol' Dirty\" Yuen); Method Man articulated its relevance on track 5 of \"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\", stating there was \"no father to his style\". Biography. Early life, formation of the Wu-Tang Clan. Russell Jones was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1968. He and his cousins Robert Diggs and Gary Grice shared a taste for rap music and martial arts-style movies. Jones, Diggs, and Grice (later known Ol' Dirty Bastard, RZA, and GZA respectively) formed the group Force of the Imperial Master, which subsequently became known as All in Together Now after their successful underground single of the same name. They eventually added six more members to their group, calling it the Wu-Tang Clan. The group released their debut album \"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\" in 1993, receiving notable commercial and critical success. Music career. Ol' Dirty Bastard's solo career began March 28, 1995. His first solo album, \"\", spawned the hit singles \"Brooklyn Zoo\" and \"Shimmy Shimmy Ya\", which helped propel the album to platinum status. The album's sound was noted by several music writers as being as \"raw and gritty\" as \"36 Chambers\", with RZA and 4th Disciple producing beats of an even more minimalist and stripped-down style than on the group's debut album. In this same year, Ol' Dirty Bastard collaborated with Mariah Carey for the \"Fantasy Remix\". Around this time, Jones gained notoriety when, as he was being profiled for an MTV biography, he took two of his thirteen children by limousine to a New York State welfare office to pick up his welfare check; his latest album was still in the top ten of the US charts. The entire incident was filmed by an MTV camera crew and was broadcast nationwide. In 1997, Ol' Dirty Bastard appeared on the Wu-Tang Clan's second and most commercially successful work, the double album \"Wu-Tang Forever\". He had fewer appearances on this album than the group's debut, contributing to one solo track (\"Dog Shit\"), three verses (\"Maria\", \"Reunited\", \"Heaterz\"), one hook (\"As High as Wu-Tang Get\"), and a spoken introduction/refrain (\"Triumph\"). In February 1998, Jones witnessed a car accident from the window of his Brooklyn recording studio. He and a friend ran to the accident scene and organized about a dozen onlookers, who assisted in lifting the 1996 Ford Mustangârescuing a 4-year-old girl from the wreckage. She was taken to a hospital with first and second degree burns. Using a false name, Jones visited the girl in the hospital frequently until he was spotted by members of the media. The evening following the traffic accident, Jones rushed on-stage unexpectedly as Shawn Colvin took the stage to give her acceptance speech for Song of the Year at the 1998 Grammy Awards, and he announced he had recently purchased expensive clothes in anticipation of winning the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album that he lost to Puff Daddy. As Colvin took the stage to a round of applause, he asked the audience, \"Please calm down, the music and everything. It's nice that I went and bought me an outfit today that costed a lot of money today, you know what I mean? 'Cause I figured that Wu-Tang was gonna win. I don't know how you all see it, but when it comes to the children, Wu-Tang is for the children. We teach the children. You know what I mean? Puffy is good, but Wu-Tang is the best, Okay? I want you all to know that this is ODB, and I love you all. Peace!\" This incident was widely covered in the mainstream media. In 1999, Ol' Dirty Bastard wrote and recorded his second studio album, \"Nigga Please\", between jail sentences. The album received notable commercial success, although it failed to parallel the critical praise of his debut. This release included the single \"Got Your Money\", which garnered worldwide chart success. The song was produced by The Neptunes and featured backing vocals by R&B singer Kelis. In 1999, Jones was paid $30,000 to appear on Insane Clown Posse's album, \"The Amazing Jeckel Brothers\". Completing his track in two days, his recording consisted of his \"rambling about bitches\". Insane Clown Posse re-recorded the track and re-edited Jones' vocals in order to form four rhymes out of his rambling, titling the song \"Bitches\". In 2001, with Jones again in jail for crack cocaine possession, his record label Elektra Records made the decision to release a greatest hits album (despite there being only two albums in his back catalog) in order to both end their contract with the artist (see below section), as well as make profit from the publicity generated by his legal troubles. After the contract with Elektra was terminated, the label D-3 records released the album \"The Trials and Tribulations of Russell Jones\" in 2002, composed of tracks compiled without Jones' input. In 2003, the day he was released from prison, with Mariah Carey and Damon Dash by his side, Jones signed a contract with Roc-A-Fella Records. Living at his mother's home under house arrest and with a court-ordered probation, he managed to star in a VH1 special, \"Inside Out: Ol' Dirty Bastard On Parole\". He also managed to record a new album, originally scheduled to be released through Dame Dash Music Group in 2004; it has since been shelved indefinitely. In October 2004, one month before his death, his last collaboration was Jon B. on the track, \"Everytime\" from the album, \"Stronger Everyday\". In 2005, he was posthumously collaborated on \"Blah-Blah-Blah\" with Brooke Valentine on her album, \"Chain Letter\". Legal troubles. In 1993, Ol' Dirty Bastard was convicted of second degree assault for an attempted robbery and in 1994, he was shot in the abdomen following an argument with another rapper. In 1997, he was arrested for failure to pay child support for three of his 13 children. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to attempted assault on his wife and was the victim of a home invasion robbery at his girlfriend's house. He was shot in the back and arm but the wounds were superficial. In July 1998, only days after being shot in a push-in robbery at his girlfriend's house in Brooklyn, he was arrested for shoplifting a pair of $50 shoes from a Sneaker Stadium store in Virginia Beach, Virginia, although he was carrying close to $500 in cash at the time. He was issued bench warrants by the Virginia Beach Sheriff's Department to stand trial after he failed to appear in court numerous times. He was arrested for criminal threatening after a series of confrontations in Los Angeles a few weeks later, and was then re-arrested for similar charges not long after that. During a traffic stop, the details of which remain clouded in multiple versions of events, he was arrested for attempted murder and criminal weapon possession. The case was later dismissed. In February 1999, he was arrested for driving without a license and for being a convicted felon wearing a bulletproof vest (the first person arrested for this infraction under a new California law). Back in New York weeks later, he was arrested for drug possession of crack cocaine and for traffic offenses. With multiple cases in the past and present, he was arrested with marijuana and 20 vials of crack. In October 2000, he escaped from his court-mandated drug treatment facility and spent one month as a fugitive. During his time on the run, he met with RZA and spent some time in their recording studio. He then appeared onstage at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York swigging a bottle at the record release party for \"The W\", the third Wu-Tang Clan album. In late November 2000, while still on the lam, he was arrested outside a South Philadelphia McDonald's (at 29th and Gray's Ferry Ave.), after he drew a crowd while signing autographs. He spent several days in a Philadelphia jail and was later extradited to New York City. A Manhattan court sentenced him to two to four years incarceration. In 2012, his FBI file was released to the public after a Freedom of Information Act request. It contains details of numerous crimes, such as alleged connections to three murders, a shoot out with the New York City Police Department, and a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act investigation against the Wu-Tang Clan. Death. Leading up to his death, Jones' legal troubles and odd behavior made him \"something of a folk hero\", according to \"The New Yorker\" writer Michael Agger. Music writer Steve Huey wrote that \"it was difficult for observers to tell whether Ol' Dirty Bastard's wildly erratic behavior was the result of serious drug problems or genuine mental instability.\" Jones collapsed at approximately 4:35 p.m. on November 13, 2004 (two days before his 36th birthday) at RZA's recording studio (36 Chambers Records LLC on West 34th Street in New York City). He was pronounced dead at 5:04pm. His funeral was held at Brooklyn's Christian Cultural Center and drew a crowd of thousands. The official cause of death was a drug overdose; an autopsy found a lethal mixture of cocaine and the prescription drug tramadol. The overdose was ruled accidental and witnesses say that Jones complained of chest pain on the day he died. Documentary. In November 2013, a biopic documentary about Ol' Dirty Bastard's life,Â \"Dirty: Platinum Edition',Â will be released by his cousin Stephon Turner aka Raison Allah and Zufilms Inc. The documentary features interviews and stories from Wu-Tang members, affiliates, and family members, as well as old interviews and live footage. The film is being distributed by New Hollywood Entertainment and is the centerpiece to the inauguralÂ NuHo Online Film FestivalÂ which is set for November 15, 2013. The film was packaged along with the \"New Wu Generation Album\" which includes never before heard tracks from Ol' Dirty, RZA, Young Dirty and features the songÂ Protect Yo Neck 2. Awards and nominations. Grammy Awards \n",

There was this white dude in his 40s who was cool as shit and would tell me, \"You’re funny and people like you. You need to move the fuck out of Ohio and just do this.\" My uncle told me I could come out there and stay with him in the South Bronx until I got on my feet. I’d never met him; this was my father’s older brother, the last of my father’s siblings, so I wanted to make that connection anyway. I moved in 2004 with my little demo and maybe $500.\" Shortly after he moved from Cleveland, a BAPE store opened up in the city, where he later applied for a job: \"I discovered what BAPE was when I moved to NY, the store opened up shortly after I moved from Cleveland. I was always a fan of the brand but it just wasn’t something I could afford back then. I remember working there my first couple of weeks in the same uniform cause I didn’t own anything prior to being hired. So it was a dream come true to be able to work at the store I dreamed of shopping in one day. Over a couple of years I might have applied at the store 3 or 4 times before the last attempt that got me hired. I fell in love with BAPE because of their color selection and artwork. I love the style of their cartoons.\" While working there Cudi met future mentor Kanye West, for the first time after forgetting to remove an anti-theft device from a jacket West had purchased. His uncle later kicked him out, leading to his writing \"Day 'n' Nite\": \"My uncle that I lived with passed in 2006. We were actually beefing because he forced me out the house when I didn’t have another situation set up, so I was bitter. I never apologized for it, and that kills me. That’s why I wrote \"Day 'n' Nite.\" If he wasn’t there to let me stay with him those first few months, there would be no Kid Cudi. It fucked me up watching him go, but it was like, \"I have to fulfill this destiny now for sure.\" Things were moving but they weren’t solidified yet. I had \"Day ’n’ Nite,\" we were just getting started, and I was like, \"This shit has got to pop off.\" I wasn’t taking no for an answer.\"  In July 2008, Kid Cudi released his first mixtape, \"A Kid Named Cudi\", in collaboration with New York street-wear brand 10.Deep as a free download.
